/* Lab Question (Test 2) 
 * 
 * Here we have used a List to hold the phonons. Given that we will need to remove phonons
 * from many different locations of the List (front, middle, back) do you think
 * this is an appropriate data structure to use? Keep in mind, we will also need repeatedly
 * iterate over the List and the List could contain many phonons. Random access is not required.
 * Justify your choice of a different data structure or explain why a List is a good choice.
 * 
 * Can you think of a clever way to remove an element from the middle of a List without having
 * to shift the memory contents of the List?
